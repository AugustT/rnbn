# rnbn
======

### Installation
----------------

To **install** the development version of rnbn, it's easiest to use the `devtools` package:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    # NOTE: If you have not installed devtools before you will need to restart you R
    # session before installing to avoid problems
    
    library(devtools)
    install_github("rnbn", username = 'JNCC-UK')
    
    library(rnbn)

If you have difficulties installing rnbn using this method try updating your version of R to the most up-to-date version available. If you still have problems please contact us or use the issues page.

### How to use the package
--------------------------

A good starting point is the vignette. Once you have installed and loaded the package use the following command and click on the link to "User guides, package vignettes and other documentation". Alternatively you can find it above in the 'doc' folder.

    help(package='rnbn')

Once you have read the vignette, the help files for each function should guide you the rest of the way. If you have any questions just get in touch via email or using the issues page.
