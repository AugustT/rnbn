# rnbn
======

### Installation
----------------

To **install** the development version of rnbn, it's easiest to use the `devtools` package:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    # NOTE: If you have not installed devtools before you will need to restart you R
    # session before installing to avoid problems
    
    library(devtools)
    install_github("rnbn", username = 'JNCC-UK')
    
    library(rnbn)

If you have difficulties installing rnbn using this method try updating your version of R to the most up-to-date version available. If you still have problems please contact us or use the issues page.

### How to us the package
-------------------------

A good starting point is the vignette which you can find above in the 'doc' folder. Once you have read that, the help files for each function should guide you the rest of the way. If you have any questions just get in touch via email or using the issues page.
